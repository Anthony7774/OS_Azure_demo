# OS_Azure_demo
Demo docker-compose with working Azure authentication

This is only for demo purposes and should only be run locally, as the IDP (Azure in this case) points back to localhost:5601


Just clone and run docker-compose up

The username is tom@testorg33313.onmicrosoft.com
The password is HowcanIhelp@

The screenshots of the Azure setup are listed as:

This should not be used as recommended setup, this is simply how I managed to get it working.
